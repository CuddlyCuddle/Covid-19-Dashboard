# Introduction
The purpose of this Dashboard is to demonstrate as well as hone some of my abilities regarding data visualization and dashboard creation in addition to creating different measurements to gauge the extent of the Covid-19 virus. Moreover, I have always found epidemiological math and modeling an interesting subject, so it was important for me to explore this subject. 

For whoever sees this, I hope you find the dashboard helpful: stay safe.

# Basic Analysis 
For this dashboard, I used data provided by Our World in data the link to the dataset is provided [here](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv). 

The first section of the analysis covers data based on the overall growth of covid-19 while the other sections break down the numbers by country. __IMPORTANT:__ ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS BASED ON CONFIRMED CASES. In addition, there is information that an individual could become susceptible once again after 3 or more months.
